### Creating Park Service Area

In creating the park service areas, we first needed to add park vertices as entrances:

After the vertices were added as entrances, they were then snapped to the closest line on the network dataset created earlier with Vancouver street data:

Finally a network service area analysis was run to configure a final service area:

Here is a comparison of what a 300 meter buffer would look like compared to the network derived service area:
