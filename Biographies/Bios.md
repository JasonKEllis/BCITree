I graduated from the University of British Columbia in 2023 with a Bachelor's degree in Urban Forestry and a minor in Urban Green-Space Management. My primary interest in GIS—encompassing data interoperability, visualizing data, managing geospatial data, deriving insights from remote sensing, and conducting geospatial analyses—is all aimed at enhancing decision-making capabilities. As I pursue the BCIT Advanced Diploma in GIS, I hope to hone my technical and programming skills, which are geared toward my interest in utilities management, natural resource management, urban planning, and data integration. During my free time, I enjoy playing PC games, exploring the outdoors, and occasionally engaging in backcountry hiking.

I graduated from the University of British Columbia in 2023 with a bachelor's degree in geography and a minor in GIS. I am now studying at BCIT in their Advanced Diploma in GIS program and am also currently working at a commercial real estate company, aiding in data acquisition and map production. I am excited to use what I have learned in my studies and hope to explore the demographic side of GIS in my career. In my free time, I like to watch movies, exercise, and hang out with my friends.

I graduated from the University of Northern British Columbia with a bachelor’s in Math and Physics in 2016. I have an interest in GIS that relates to natural resources and have had the opportunity to work with several community forest organizations. This work included silviculture surveys, mapping, and modeling. I am currently enrolled in the GIS Advanced Diploma program at BCIT and am excited to broaden my skill set. In my free time, I enjoy outdoor activities such as biking, snowboarding, and rock climbing.
